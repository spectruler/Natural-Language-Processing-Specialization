# Natural Langugage Processing Specialization
Natual Language Processing Specialization is an series of courses on coursera by deeplearning.ai to master Natural Language Processing concepts and practical aspects. 

# 1. Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

This is the first course in the series, consisted of 4 weeks, which covers traditional methods including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes on Sentiment Analysis task - which is an classification problem, and KNN, Locality Sensitive Hashing to Approximate KNN for Machine Translation.

# 2. Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models

Being second course in series, it covers Probabilistic models and practical applications:
* Auto Correct
* Viterbi Algorithm and Its Applications
* Suggestions 
* Word Embeddings 

# 3. Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models

Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models is third course of Natural Language Processing Specialization. It covers concepts like:
* Neural Networks in Classification
* Sequence Models like: 
    * Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    * Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
    * Deep and Bi-directional RNN
    * Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
* Training of Named Entity Recognition Tasks
* Siamese Networks
* Triplet Loss
